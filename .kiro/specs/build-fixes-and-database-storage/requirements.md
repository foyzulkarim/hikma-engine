# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical build errors in the hikma-engine codebase and implements the first version of database storage functionality for both RDBMS (SQLite) and GraphDB (TinkerGraph) systems. The goal is to create a stable, working codebase that can successfully index code repositories and persist the extracted knowledge graph data to multiple database backends.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to compile without errors, so that I can build and run the hikma-engine successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN variable scoping issues exist THEN the system SHALL resolve duplicate variable declarations
3. WHEN missing imports are detected THEN the system SHALL add the required import statements
4. WHEN type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL correct the type annotations and assignments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to store extracted knowledge graph data in SQLite database, so that I can perform fast metadata queries and lookups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nodes are processed THEN the system SHALL store node data in SQLite tables
2. WHEN edges are processed THEN the system SHALL store relationship data in SQLite tables
3. WHEN database schema is needed THEN the system SHALL create appropriate tables for nodes and edges
4. WHEN data persistence fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to store knowledge graph relationships in TinkerGraph database, so that I can perform complex graph traversals and relationship queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN graph data is ready THEN the system SHALL connect to TinkerGraph database
2. WHEN nodes are processed THEN the system SHALL create vertices in TinkerGraph
3. WHEN edges are processed THEN the system SHALL create edges between vertices in TinkerGraph
4. WHEN graph operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle connection errors and provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the data persistence layer to work with both databases simultaneously, so that I can leverage the strengths of both RDBMS and graph database systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data persistence is triggered THEN the system SHALL write to both SQLite and TinkerGraph databases
2. WHEN one database operation fails THEN the system SHALL continue with the other database and log the error
3. WHEN transaction consistency is required THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate error handling and rollback mechanisms
4. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity before attempting data operations
