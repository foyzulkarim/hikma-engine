# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Remove TinkerGraphClient class and Gremlin dependencies
  - Delete the entire TinkerGraphClient class from src/persistence/db-clients.ts

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Update DataLoader to remove TinkerGraph initialization and operations
  - Remove TinkerGraph client initialization from DataLoader constructor
  - Remove TinkerGraph connection logic from connectToDatabases method
  - Update connectToDatabases return type to only include lancedb and sqlite status
  - Remove TinkerGraph disconnection logic from disconnectFromDatabases method
  - Update load method result type to exclude TinkerGraph results
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Remove TinkerGraph configuration from config system
  - Remove tinkergraph configuration from DatabaseConfig interface in src/config/index.ts
  - Remove tinkergraph default configuration values
  - Remove HIKMA_TINKERGRAPH_URL environment variable handling
  - Clean up any TinkerGraph-related configuration comments
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Update health check service to remove TinkerGraph monitoring
  - Remove checkTinkerGraph method from src/api/services/health-check.ts
  - Remove TinkerGraph health check from getSystemHealth method
  - Update health check response format to exclude tinkergraph status
  - Remove TinkerGraph-related health check comments and documentation
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Update documentation and comments to reflect simplified architecture
  - Update file header comments in data-loader.ts to remove TinkerGraph references
  - Update configuration guide documentation to remove TinkerGraph sections
  - Update API documentation to reflect two-database architecture
  - Remove TinkerGraph references from implementation plan and other documentation files
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Update unit tests to remove TinkerGraph test cases
  - Remove TinkerGraph-related test cases from existing test files
  - Update DataLoader tests to only test LanceDB and SQLite connections
  - Update health check tests to exclude TinkerGraph health check testing
  - Update integration tests to reflect two-database architecture
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Validate SQLite graph functionality works correctly
  - Test enhanced graph node insertion using existing SQLite methods
  - Test enhanced graph edge insertion using existing SQLite methods
  - Verify graph statistics queries return correct results
  - Test graph traversal operations using SQLite recursive CTEs
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Update package.json to remove Gremlin dependencies
  - Remove any Gremlin-related packages from package.json dependencies
  - Remove TinkerGraph-related packages if they exist
  - Update package-lock.json by running npm install after dependency removal
  - Verify the application builds successfully without Gremlin dependencies
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 9. Test complete system functionality with simplified architecture
  - Run full indexing pipeline to ensure it works with only LanceDB and SQLite
  - Verify all graph operations work correctly using SQLite enhanced graph tables
  - Test API endpoints to ensure health checks work with simplified database architecture
  - Validate that no TinkerGraph references remain in the codebase
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 10. Update environment configuration and deployment documentation
  - Remove HIKMA_TINKERGRAPH_URL from .env.example file
  - Update Docker configuration to remove TinkerGraph server requirements
  - Update deployment scripts to reflect simplified database architecture
  - Update configuration guide to remove TinkerGraph setup instructions
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_
