# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a web API service that provides semantic and powerful searching capabilities on top of the existing hikma-engine indexed code knowledge graph. The API will expose endpoints for different types of searches including semantic similarity, code structure queries, git history searches, and hybrid search combining multiple dimensions of the indexed data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform semantic searches on indexed codebases, so that I can find relevant code snippets based on natural language queries or code similarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL return semantically similar code snippets ranked by relevance
2. WHEN a user submits a code snippet as a query THEN the system SHALL return similar code patterns from the indexed codebase
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include file paths, line numbers, and context snippets
4. WHEN no relevant results are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty result set with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for code structures and patterns, so that I can find functions, classes, or modules that match specific criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for functions by name pattern THEN the system SHALL return matching function definitions with their signatures
2. WHEN a user searches for classes or interfaces THEN the system SHALL return matching type definitions with their properties and methods
3. WHEN a user searches for imports or dependencies THEN the system SHALL return files that use specific modules or libraries
4. WHEN structure search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include AST metadata and code context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search through git history and authorship data, so that I can understand code evolution and find changes related to specific features or bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches by commit message keywords THEN the system SHALL return relevant commits with file changes
2. WHEN a user searches by author THEN the system SHALL return code contributions by specific developers
3. WHEN a user searches by time range THEN the system SHALL return code changes within the specified period
4. WHEN git search results are returned THEN the system SHALL include commit metadata, diff summaries, and affected files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform hybrid searches combining multiple search dimensions, so that I can find code using complex criteria that span semantic meaning, structure, and history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user combines semantic and structural filters THEN the system SHALL return results matching both criteria
2. WHEN a user combines git history with code structure searches THEN the system SHALL return code elements with their evolution history
3. WHEN hybrid search parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL weight and rank results appropriately across dimensions
4. WHEN hybrid searches are performed THEN the system SHALL provide clear indication of which criteria each result matches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access search functionality through a REST API, so that I can integrate semantic search into my development tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API receives a GET request to /search/semantic THEN it SHALL process semantic queries and return JSON results
2. WHEN the API receives a GET request to /search/structure THEN it SHALL process structural queries and return AST-based results
3. WHEN the API receives a GET request to /search/git THEN it SHALL process git history queries and return commit-related results
4. WHEN the API receives a GET request to /search/hybrid THEN it SHALL process multi-dimensional queries and return combined results
5. WHEN API requests include pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return paginated results with appropriate metadata
6. WHEN API requests are malformed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure search behavior and filters, so that I can customize search results based on my project's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration specifies file type filters THEN the system SHALL only search within specified file extensions
2. WHEN configuration specifies directory exclusions THEN the system SHALL skip searching in excluded paths
3. WHEN configuration specifies result limits THEN the system SHALL respect maximum result counts per query type
4. WHEN configuration specifies similarity thresholds THEN the system SHALL filter results below the specified relevance scores
