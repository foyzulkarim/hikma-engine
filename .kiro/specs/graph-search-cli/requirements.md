# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The hikma-engine project needs a new CLI command for graph data search functionality that allows developers to explore function call relationships within the indexed codebase. This feature will enable users to understand code dependencies and call chains by providing a function name and seeing which functions are called to and from that function, which is the core essence of the graph data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for function call relationships using the unified CLI, so that I can understand how functions interact within my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph calls <function-name>` THEN the system SHALL display all functions that the specified function calls
2. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph calls <function-name>` THEN the system SHALL display all functions that call the specified function
3. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph calls <function-name>` THEN the system SHALL show file paths and line numbers for each function relationship

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to find call chains between functions, so that I can trace execution paths through my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph chain <from-function> <to-function>` THEN the system SHALL find and display the shortest call path between the two functions
2. WHEN no call chain exists THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating no path was found
3. WHEN multiple functions with the same name exist THEN the system SHALL provide disambiguation options with file paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to explore graph statistics and search capabilities, so that I can understand the structure of my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph stats` THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive graph statistics including node counts, edge counts, and type breakdowns
2. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph search <pattern>` THEN the system SHALL find all functions matching the pattern using regex
3. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph functions <file-path>` THEN the system SHALL list all functions defined in the specified file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze file dependencies through the graph, so that I can understand module relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph deps <file-path>` THEN the system SHALL show all files that depend on the specified file
2. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph imports <file-path>` THEN the system SHALL show all files that the specified file imports from
3. WHEN a file has no dependencies THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating no dependencies found

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent output formatting and error handling for graph commands, so that the experience matches other hikma CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any graph command encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display consistent error messages with helpful context
2. WHEN any graph command produces results THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting with colors and clear structure
3. WHEN a user runs `hikma graph --help` THEN the system SHALL display all available graph subcommands with descriptions and examples
