# Current Implementation Status

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the hikma-engine project as of July 2025. The project has undergone a significant architectural refactoring from a numbered sequential module approach to a domain-oriented structure.

## Project Structure

The project is now organized into the following main directories:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Centralized configuration management
â”œâ”€â”€ core/            # Core orchestration logic (Indexer)
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/         # Domain-specific processing modules
â”œâ”€â”€ persistence/     # Database clients and data access
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Shared utilities (logging, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ index.ts         # Main CLI entry point
```

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. Domain-Oriented Structure
- Moved from numbered modules (01_file_discovery.ts, etc.) to descriptive names
- Clear separation of concerns across directories
- Improved maintainability and code organization

### 2. Centralized Configuration
- Single source of truth for all configuration
- Environment variable support for deployment flexibility
- Type-safe configuration management

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Comprehensive error tracking throughout the pipeline
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Detailed error reporting and logging

### 4. Improved CLI Experience
- Rich command-line interface with help system
- Multiple indexing modes and options
- Clear result reporting and error messages

## Current Capabilities

The hikma-engine can currently:

1. **Scan and analyze** codebases in multiple programming languages
2. **Parse AST structures** to extract functions, classes, and relationships
3. **Analyze Git history** for file evolution and commit patterns
4. **Generate AI summaries** for files and directories
5. **Create vector embeddings** for semantic similarity
6. **Store data** in unified SQLite database with vector extension support
7. **Perform incremental indexing** to process only changed files
8. **Provide detailed logging** and performance metrics

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- `@xenova/transformers`: AI model integration for embeddings
- `better-sqlite3`: SQLite database operations

- `sqlite-vec`: Vector extension for SQLite database operations
- `glob`: File pattern matching
- `simple-git`: Git repository analysis

### Development Dependencies
- `typescript`: Type checking and compilation
- `ts-node`: Development execution
- `jest`: Testing framework
- `eslint`: Code quality enforcement

## Configuration Options

The system supports extensive configuration through:

### Database Configuration
- SQLite path for unified storage (metadata, graph, and vectors)
- Vector extension path for sqlite-vec binary

### AI Configuration
- Embedding model selection and batch size
- Summary model and token limits

### Indexing Configuration
- File patterns and ignore rules
- Maximum file size limits
- Supported programming languages

### Logging Configuration
- Log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Console and file output options
- Custom log file paths

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
npm start                    # Index current directory
npm start /path/to/project   # Index specific project
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
npm start --force-full       # Force complete re-indexing
npm start --dry-run          # Test run without persistence
npm start --skip-ai-summary  # Skip AI summary generation
npm start --skip-embeddings  # Skip vector embedding generation
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes changed files by default
- **Batch Operations**: Database operations are batched for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Streaming processing for large repositories
- **Error Recovery**: Continues processing despite individual file failures

## Next Steps for Development

While the core architecture is complete, potential areas for enhancement include:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization of database operations
2. **Additional Language Support**: Expanding AST parsing capabilities
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated code analysis features
4. **API Development**: REST API for external integrations
5. **Visualization**: Web interface for exploring knowledge graphs
6. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom analyzers

## Conclusion

The hikma-engine has successfully transitioned from a prototype to a well-architected, production-ready code analysis system. The refactored structure provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining clean separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling.
